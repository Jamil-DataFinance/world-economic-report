# world-economic-report in python

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of global economic indicators sourced from World Bank and Human Development Index (HDI) datasets. The goal is to assess economic trends across countries and offer insights into the comparative economic performance and population dynamics of various regions.

## Data Sources
World Bank Data: Provides key economic metrics such as GDP and GDP per capita.

HDI Data: Complements the economic dataset with Human Development Index measures, helping to contextualize economic performance within broader development indicators.

## Key Features
Data Preparation & QA:
Import and clean data from multiple sources.
Perform profiling and quality assurance to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Data Analysis :
Conduct comparative analysis across countries and regions.
Explore relationships between GDP, population, and HDI to uncover meaningful economic insights.

1. GDP Growth by Region (Stacked Area Chart):

This chart visualizes how GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has changed over time for different geographic regions. The stacked area design allows for easy comparison of regional growth patterns.
2. Population Growth by Region (Stacked Area Chart):

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef54208e-003c-487a-8cb1-7ff90386eb2c)


Similar to GDP, this chart showcases population growth trends across regions. This helps understand population shifts and potential impacts on development resources.
3. Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita (Bubble Chart):

This plot explores the relationship between life expectancy and economic well-being (GDP per capita) for individual countries. The size of the bubbles represents the population size, and color-coding indicates region. This visualization allows for identifying potential correlations between economic prosperity and health outcomes.
4. Average HDI by Region (Bar Chart):

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/404f4b7a-f2bd-4fc2-b390-a38d4e4b8a4d)

This chart presents the average Human Development Index (HDI) for each region. HDI is a composite measure of a country's health, education, and standard of living. This helps assess the overall development level across regions.
5. Power Consumption vs. GDP per Capita (Scatter Plot):
![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f2a1d1e-fd8a-40e6-acf9-a060c61f8986)


This plot explores the relationship between a country's economic output (GDP per capita) and its energy consumption (electric power consumption per capita). The color of each data point represents the country's HDI score. This visualization can reveal potential links between economic growth, energy consumption, and human development.
